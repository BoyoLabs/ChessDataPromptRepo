This is a raw data/analysis prompt repo regarding a personal chess evaluation and analysis for LLM's on bullet chess games of my heuristical style. It is more a useful (to me) proof of concept. The hope in sharing this prompt repo is that prompt engineering is demonstrated to be a form of meta-programming.

To get the full idea of what is going on, check the code (not the preview) of the .md file.

TO USE: download the .md file and upload it to your LLM asking it questions about your (my) game. Can use a PGN and compare, or just ask generally about the data.
